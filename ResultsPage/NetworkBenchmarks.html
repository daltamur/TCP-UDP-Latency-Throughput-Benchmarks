<h1>UDP & TCP Latency/Throughput Benchmarking</h1>
<h2>Dominic Altamura</h2>

<h2>Project Design</h2>
<p>
    To measure latency and throughput I designed the project such that one must run the server that will accept data and send back a response.
    The server is designed to continually listen until it is told to stop at the end of benchmark. Once it receives a message from the
    client that the benchmark is over, it begins listening for data that is specific for the next benchmark until all benchmarks have finished.
</p>

<p>
    The client are designed to first test the latency and throughput using UDP and then TCP. Latency is tested by generating a random byte array
    and encrypting its byte values with an XOR cipher. This value is then sent over to the server which decrypts the value with the same cipher
    and sending the decrypted packet back as an acknowledgement packet and the client then verifies that the decrypted value sent back by the server matches the
    original byte array. The time this process takes is recorded and the average time of performing this task 5000 times is recorded as the average latency.
    After the task is performed 5000 times, the client sends a message to the server that is equal to the string value of "STOP"
    so that the server will stop listening for data from the current benchmark. The latency is measured in seconds.
    This test is first done with messages of size 8 bytes, 32 bytes, 512 bytes, and 1024 bytes.
</p>

<p>
    Throughput is tested by sending x amount of packets that are of size y to the server. A byte array with random values is again generated and
    the client encrypts the value of the array with an XOR cipher. This is sent to the server that decrypts the byte array
    and sends back the first 8 bytes of the decrypted value since this assignment limits throughput benchmarks to only use
    8 byte acknowledgement packets. The client receives these 8 bytes and verifies that the first 8 bytes of the original
    byte array are equal to the acknowledgement packet. The time it takes for this task to perform this task x times is
    recorded and the throughput is calculated with the equation throughput = (numberOfPackets*packetSize*8)/(totalTime).
    Latency is measured as bits per second. The test is fdone with 1024 1024 byte messages, 2045 512 byte messages, and 8192 128 byte messages.

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>
    I've worked with TCP in the past, so setting up the server and client for the benchmarks with this protocol was relatively easy. However, with UDP, it was an
    entirely different experience since I never used it before. With UDP connections not requiring an initial connection, I had to rethink how I was setting
    up my server and client so that the server was always properly synchronized to be listening for data from the client and vice versa. Once I was able to do
    this though, the UDP server and client were relatively easy to implement and I was able to develop it quicker than I did the TCP client and server
    since a lot of the code needed when using a TCP protocol carried over when using a UDP protocol and I just had to make some necessary changes
    to accommodate a connectionless protocol.
</p>

<p>
    The only other problem I ran into was with the Oswego residence hall network's firewalls. When setting up the UDP server and client, I was running into an issue
    where I was attempting to use my laptop as a server and Moxie as a client and found that my laptop can only receive datagram packets <i>if</i> it initially sends
    one out to Moxie. After some research, I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14471438/java-datagramsocketudp-socket-only-receives-when-previously-have-sent-a-packet">this</a> Stack Overflow
    question where it would appear that initially sending out a packet opens the firewall and allows for data to be sent through it for a period of time.
    At this point, I just made sure to only use my laptop as a client and use Moxie as a server for my benchmarks and the problem was resolved so that
    I did not need to have the server send an initial message to the client so that it could start receiving messages.
